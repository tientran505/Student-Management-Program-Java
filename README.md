- For "**Import student list from .csv file**" requirement, you need to put the files need to be imported inside the folder named "**data**" 
- For "**Export student list to .csv file**" requirement, you can check the exported files inside the folder named "**output**"
- For "**View student list (by GPA and student ID)**" requirement, you should use terminal that supports UTF-8 display (such as terminal in intelliJ)
so that the information is displayed correctly
- The default data will be saved in the "default.csv" file, you can check in "data" folder, which will be run at the same time as the program runs.
- If the "default.csv" file is not found, the data in the program will be empty, now you can use the "**Add Student**" or "**Import Student List**" functionality 
to add data.
- If you import new data, you can choose to keep the old data or delete all old data.
